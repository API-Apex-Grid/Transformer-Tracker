# Apex Grid

## 🚀 Live app

- Production (deployed): <https://apex-grid-transformer-tracker.vercel.app/>
- Want to run everything locally? Use the instructions in `Instructions.md`.

## 🔒 Auth

- Log in with `user1`..`user5` using the same value as the password (e.g., `user3`/`user3`).
- Backend handles user creation/verification on first successful login at `/api/login`.
- The UI shows “Logged in as username” and records `uploadedBy` for created/updated entities and images.

## 💫 Features

- Transformers and Inspections CRUD (App Router API routes with Prisma)
- Image uploads stored as base64 in the DB; baseline images can be added/removed
- Favourites: toggle star in lists; filter by favourites via checkbox
- Search/filters:
  - Transformers: by transformer number, pole number; region/type dropdowns
  - Inspections: similar search inputs
- Validation:
  - Adding/Editing Inspections: transformer must exist; minimum date is today
  - Adding Transformers: client-side check to ensure `transformerNumber` is unique
- Cascade delete: deleting a Transformer removes its Inspections
- Now available in dark mode!

## 🔁 CI / CD

This project uses automated deployments for both frontend and backend:

- Frontend (Next.js) — deployed on Vercel
  - The `frontend/` directory is connected to Vercel via the GitHub integration. Pushes to `main` (or PR merges depending on your Vercel settings) trigger Vercel builds and automatic deployments of the site.

- Backend (Spring Boot) — deployed on Render via DockerHub
  - A GitHub Actions workflow builds the backend and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub. See `.github/workflows/docker-image-deployed.yml` for the workflow (it sets up Java, runs `mvn -DskipTests package`, builds the image, and pushes it to Docker Hub).
  - The workflow expects the following GitHub Secrets to be configured in this repository:
    - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` — Docker Hub account name
    - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` — Docker Hub access token or password
  - Docker Hub is configured with a repository that Render watches. When the image is pushed, Docker Hub calls the Render deploy hook which triggers Render to deploy the new container image.
